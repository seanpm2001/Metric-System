# Metric SI metre/meter units proposal

This is my planned proposal to the expansion of the Metric System from June/July 2019/2020. They were made public a few days ago, and were made into a separate file on a separate repository on 2021, July 22nd at 7:01 pm.

This document was updated on 2026, February 9th to add support for the correct, international spelling (metre) Previously, only United States spelling (meter) was used. A supplemental update adding support for 4 new units was made on 2026, February 10th, although 2 units remain partially undefined (see [issue #4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Metric-System/issues/4))

# United States spelling

## Existing units

1. Kilometer

## New units

These are for the units equal to powers of 10 (1000m = 1 km, etc.)

1. 1 Megameter (MM) = 1,000,000 meters, or 1,000 kilometers

2. 1 Gigameter (GM) = 1,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 megameters, or 1,000,000 kilometers

3. 1 Terameter (TM) = 1,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000 kilometers

4. 1 Petameter (PM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 terameters, or 1,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 kilometers

5. 1 Exameter (EM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 petameters, or 1,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

6. 1 Zettameter (ZM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 exameters, or 1,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

7. 1 Yottameter (YM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 zettameters, or 1,000,000 exameters, or 1,000,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

8. 1 Ronnameter (RM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 Yottameters, or 1,000,000 zettameters, or 1,000,000,000 exameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

9. 1 Quettameter (QM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 Ronnameters, or 1,000,000 Yottameters, or 1,000,000,000 zettameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 exameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

Additional units

1. 1 Decameter (DEM) = 10 meters

2. 1 Hectameter (HEM) = 100 meters

These are for the units equal to powers of 2 (1024m = 1 kim, etc.)

1. 1 Kibimetre (1 KiM) = 2^10 meters

2. 1 Mebimetre (1 MiM) = 1024^2 meters

3. 1 Gibimetre (1 GiM) = 1024^3 meters

4. 1 Tebimetre (1 TiM) = 1024^4 meters

5. 1 Pebimetre (1 PiM) = 1024^5 meters

6. 1 Exbimetre (1 EiM) = 1024^6 meters

7. 1 Zebimetre (1 ZiM) = 1024^7 meters

8. 1 Yobimetre (1 YiM) = 1024^8 meters

9. 1 Ronnametre (1 RiM) = 1024^9 meters

10. 1 Quettametre (1 QiM) = 1024^10 meters

... and so on ...

Additional units

1. 1 Decametre (DeM) = UNDEFINED

2. 1 Hectametre (HeM) = UNDEFINED

## Notes

1. I am not sure if Megameter can be used.

2. 1 KiM (Kibimeter) is not to be confused with the surname of Kim

3. 1 MiM (Mebimeter) is not to be confused with the word Mime

4. 1 TiM (Tebimeter) is not to be confused with the surname of Tim/Timothy

5. 1 PM (Petameter) is not to be confused with the time 1:00 pm/13:00

6. Terameter (TM) is not trademarked, and is not to be confused with the concept/symbol of TM (TradeMark)

7. 1 GM (Gigameter) is not to be confused with the General Motors auto company

8. 1 MM (Megameter) is not to be confused with 1 Millimeter, a second reason why Megameter may not be usable

9. Brontometer/Brontometre can also be used, but it is the unofficial term for Ronna-/Ronto-

10. Geopmeter/Geopmetre can also be used, but it is the unofficial term for Quetta-/Quecto-

11. A proper base 2 value for Decameters/Decametres and Hectameters/Hectametres is currently missing. See the top of the file (which links to an issue regarding community feedback here)

12. No other notes at the moment.
