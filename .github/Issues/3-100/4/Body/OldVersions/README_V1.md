### Description

Upon implementing #3 today, I ran into a mathematical error, regarding the base 10 to base 2 conversion (I don't know what the equivalent would be for 10, 100, in a system where 1,024 (base 2) is equivalent to 1,000 (base 10)) I am having difficulty figuring this out, so I am leaving it up to community feedback.
